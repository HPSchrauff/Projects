%	A Note
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

%This CV template is based on sections and information that matched my background, and is meant to serve as a template for formatting, not for what should or should not go into your CV. 
% Please feel free to add sections such as Teaching Experience and Courses Taken, and feel free to remove sections that are not relevant for you

% Keep in mind that you should view your application package holistically - if the application is asking you for a course form or to list courses on their online application, you do not need to add those to the CV. Similarly, you will be talking about your research experience in detail in the SOP, so keep the descriptions brief on your CV

% Aim for a 1 page CV
