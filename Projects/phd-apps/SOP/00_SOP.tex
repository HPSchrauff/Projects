My research interest is to explore how dynamic interactions between customers, suppliers, and indirect participants affect market structure. To explore this topic, I am interested in using both large-scale observational and experimental data to apply empirical methods to theoretical models. I have dedicated myself to build the necessary statistical, mathematical, and data-wrangling skills necessary to answer these questions from my time as an undergraduate student at UT-Austin to a  predoctoral fellowship at HBS. \\

My specific interest in how customers and suppliers interact is in how each party learns about the other and updates their beliefs. For example, during my predoctoral fellowship I worked with Professor Alex MacKay on exploring the impact of dynamic, algorithmic pricing. \parencite{https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA16180}
